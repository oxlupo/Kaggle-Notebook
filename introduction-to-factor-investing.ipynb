We'll delve into:\n\n1. **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**: This fundamental model establishes the relationship between risk and expected return for an investment. We'll calculate the CAPM beta, a measure of an asset's sensitivity to market movements, and assess its expected return.\n\n2. **Fama-French Model**: Building upon CAPM, the Fama-French Model incorporates additional factors besides market risk to explain return variations. We'll explore these factors and their influence on asset performance.\n\n3. **Factor Benchmarks**: We'll construct factor benchmarks to compare an asset's performance against a basket of securities representing specific risk factors. This allows us to isolate an investment's performance relative to these factors.\n\n4. **Sharpe Style Analysis**: This analysis technique helps us decompose an investment's return into its exposure to various factors like market risk, size, value, and profitability. This provides valuable insights into the sources of the investment's returns.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-07T12:13:04.245068Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-07T12:13:04.245683Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-07T12:13:08.976219Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-07T12:13:04.245631Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-07T12:13:08.975002Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n%matplotlib inline","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-07T12:13:08.978320Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-07T12:13:08.978837Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.026445Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-07T12:13:08.978806Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.025037Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys\nsys.path.insert(1, '/kaggle/input/edhec-investment-management-datasets')\nimport edhec_risk_kit as erk","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.033997Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.034492Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.097664Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.034441Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.096411Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# using seaborn style (type plt.style.available to see available styles)\nplt.style.use(\"seaborn-dark\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.099059Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.099483Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.138864Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.099446Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.137718Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Factor investing\n\nA **factor** is a variable that influences the **returns of assets**. It represents a **commonality** \nin the returns, i.e., something outside the individual asset, and normally, \n**an exposure to some factor risk** over the long run **yields a reward** (the risk premium).\n\nThere are three types of factors:\n1. **Macro factors**: industrial growth, inflation,$\\dots$\n2. **Statistical factors**: something  extracted from the data, which may be or may not be well identified\n3. **Style (Intrinsic) factors**: value-growth, momentum, low-volatility$\\dots$\n\nFor example, some investors consider **Oil prices** to be an important factor in determining equity returns (they are likely to affect stock returns). This would be an example of **macro factor** \nas it is neither a statistical artifact nor is it intrinsic to the stock itself.\n\n### Factor models\n\nA **factor model** simply decompose asset returns $r$ into a set of **factor premia**:\n$$\nr = \\beta_1 f_1 + \\beta_2 f_2 + \\dots + \\beta_n f_n + \\alpha + \\varepsilon,\n$$\nwhere $\\{\\beta_i\\}_{i=1,\\dots,n}$ are some real coefficients and \n$\\{f_i\\}_{i=1,\\dots,n}$ are the **factor premia which are** nothing but that **the returns that we get in exchange for exposing ourselves to the factor**. \n\nIn other words, a factor model is **a decomposition of an asset return into a set of returns from other assets**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n\nThe **CAPM** is in some sense an example of factor model. In particular, it is used to determine a theoretically appropriate return of an asset to make decisions about adding this asset \nto a well-diversified portfolio.\n\nThe model takes into account the asset's sensitivity to non-diversifiable risk (also known as systematic risk or market risk), often represented by the quantity beta (Î²) in the financial industry, as well as the expected return of the market and the expected return of a theoretical risk-free asset. \n\nThe model can be used for pricing an individual security. The model defines a \n**Security Market Line (SML)** which enables us to compute the reward-to-risk ratio for a security in relation to that of the **overall market**:\n$$\n\\text{SML}: \\;\\mathbb{E}[r_i] = \\beta_i(\\mathbb{E}[r_m] - r_f) + r_f, \n$$\nwhich means that the **excess return** of the asset $i$ is given by the **excess return of the market** \n(here, **$r_m$ is the return of the market** and $r_f$ is the risk-free rate) \ntimes a coefficient $\\beta_i$ defined as:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[r_i] - r_f = \\beta_i(\\mathbb{E}[r_m] - r_f), \n\\qquad  \n\\beta_i := \\frac{\\text{Cov}(r_i,r_m)}{\\text{Var}(r_m)}, \n$$\nwhich is the **sensitivity of the asset with respect to the market**.\n\nNote that if $\\beta_i$ is large, it means that the asset $i$ is higly correlated with the market, i.e., if the market goes up and so goes up the asset (and, of course, if the market goes down, then the asset goes down). On the other hand, if $\\beta_i$ is very small, it means that the stock is almost uncorrelated with respect to the market, hence changes in the market do not affect the returns of the asset.\n\nIn addition, note that **the expected market return** is usually estimated by measuring **the arithmetic average of the historical returns of market components**.\n\nBy definition of factor model, **the CAPM is a one-factor model** since the excess return of the security depends **only** ont the excess return of the market. Also look at the **capital market line (CML)** we have described in the week 1 of the first course.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Price-to-book (P/B) ratio (or Market-to-book ratio)\n\nIn accounting, the **book value is the value of an asset according to its balance sheet account balance**. \nFor assets, the value is based on **the original cost of the asset less any depreciation, amortization or impairment costs** \nmade against the asset. Traditionally, a company's book value is its total assets minus intangible assets and liabilities.\n\nThe **price-to-book (P/B) ratio**, is used to compare a company's current market price to its book value. \nThe calculation can be performed in two ways. One, in which the company's market capitalization is \ndivided by the company's total book value from its balance sheet. A second way is to divide the company's current share price \nby the book value per share (i.e. its book value divided by the number of outstanding shares).\n\nSuch ratio is also called **market-to-book ratio**.\n\n#### Value stocks and Growth stocks\n\nNote that the inverse of the P/B ratio, is therefore called the **book-to-price (B/P)** (or **book-to-market**) **ratio**. \n\nAssets (e.g., stocks) with high **book-to-market** ratios are called **Value stocks**. If this ratio is high, it then means that the book value is much larger than the current market price, and this indicates that this asset is somehow cheap with respect to its true value (it is **undervalued** by the market).\n\nOn the other hand, assets with low **book-to-market** ratios are called **Growth stocks**. In this case, it then means that the book value is much samller than the current market price which indicates that the asset is somehow **overvalued** by the market. The reason why they may be overvalued is because they are associated with high-quality, successful companies whose earnings are expected to continue \ngrowing at an above-average rate relative to the market and then growth stock investors may be willing to pay more to own shares. \nAnalysts tend to classify a stock as Growht Stock if its **ROE** (**Return on equity**: company's net income divide by average common equity) is larger than or equal to $15\\%$.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Fama-French Model\n\nThe **Fama-French model** is a **three-factor** model which enhance the CAPM (one-factor model). The three factors are:\n- the market risk (i.e., as in the CAPM),\n- the outperformance of **small versus big** companies,\n- the outperformance of **high book/market versus small book/market** companies.\n\nWhat Fama and French did was to take the entire universe of stocks an put them into ten buckets (**deciles**). They sorted such deciles in two ways. \n\nA first sorting was done according to the **size**, i.e., the **market capitalization**, \nand then they compared the performance of the bottom $10\\%$ companies versus the top $10\\%$ companies according to the size.\n\nThe second sorting was done according to the **book-to-market ratios** (B/P ratio), and then they did the same, i.e., they looked at \nthe performance of the bottom $10\\%$ companies (Growth Stocks) versus the top $10\\%$ companies (Value Stocks). \n\nFama and French observed that the classes of stocks that have tended to do better than the market as a whole have been \n(i) the **small caps** (bottom decile w.r.t sizes) and (ii) the **Value Stocks** (top decile w.r.t. B/P ratios). \n\nHence, they introduced the **size factor** and the **value factor** in addition to the **market factor** \nof simple CAPM and enhance the model ($1993$): \n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[r_i] - r_f = \n\\beta_{i,\\text{MKT}}\\mathbb{E}[r_m - r_f] + \\beta_{i,\\text{SMB}}\\mathbb{E}[\\text{SMB}] + \\beta_{i,\\text{HMS}}\\mathbb{E}[\\text{HMS}]  \n$$\nwhere:\n- $\\beta_{i,\\text{MKT}}$ is the same $\\beta$ of the CAPM (we stress the dependence on the **market**), \n- $\\text{SMB}$ means **Small (size) Minus Big (size)** stocks, \n- $\\text{HML}$ means **High (B/P ratio) Minus Low (B/P ratio)** stocks.\n\nThere could be in principle more factors to add. \nFor example, the **Carhart four-factor model** enhance the Fama-French model by adding the **Momentum factor**. The **Momentum** \nin a stock is the tendency for the stock price to continue rising if it is going up and to continue declining if it is going down. It can be computed by subtracting the equal weighted average of the lowest performing firms from the equal weighted average of the highest \nperforming firms, lagged one month.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Factor benchmark\n\nAny factor model can be re-interpreted as a benchmark. \nFor example, consider the case of single CAMP model. We can rewrite it in the following way:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[r_i - r_f] = \\beta\\, \\mathbb{E}[r_m - r_f] + \\alpha\n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n\\mathbb{E}[r_i] = \\beta\\, \\mathbb{E}[r_m] - (\\beta-1) \\mathbb{E}[r_f]   + \\alpha.\n$$\nThis means that if I have $1$ dollar I can **borrow $\\beta-1$ dollars** and **invest $\\beta$ dollars in the market**. \nFor instance, let $\\beta=1.3$. It means that we borrow $\\beta-1=0.3$ cents and then we put $1.3$ dollars in the market.\nWe can always do this and we would get some return (equal to $1.3\\,\\mathbb{E}[r_m] - 0.3\\,\\mathbb{E}[r_f]$).\n\nNow, if we see that there is some asset in the market that have a return higher than what we got, \nthen it means that it is the **value added by the manager**, i.e., the manager of that assets did particularly well.\n\nIn other words, we have this model and some manager (i.e., we have some asset $i$), **we do the regression** by finding $\\beta$ \n**and we look for alpha**. **If we do not get any alpha**, it means that **this asset is not going to adding any value to us**, \njust because we could get the same return without this asset (by doing the short-long trick above).\nIn particular, if we found a positive $\\alpha$ that manager (asset) gives some values to us. If $\\alpha$ is negative, we should avoid investing in that asset as it destroys value.\n\nIn this sense we say that, in this case, the **factor benchmarck is a short position of $\\beta-1$ dollars in cash (T-bills)** and a \n**leveraged position of $\\beta$ dollars in the market portfolio**. \n\n### Style analysis\n\nThe **Returns-based style** (or simply **style**) analysis was introduced by W. Sharpe (which also contributes to the CAPM). \nIt can be regarded as a **constrained form of factor model**, \nand it has been applied to the analysis of the performance of active managers.\n\nBasically, Sharpe tooks what looked like a factor model without effectively using factors but some kind of **explanatory variables** (i.e., \nhe simply rewrote the model as we have done above):\n$$\nr_t^m = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\beta_i r_t^i + \\alpha + \\varepsilon, \n$$\nwhere $r_t^m$ is the historical returns of the manager (the asset) we are considering, $\\{r_{t}^{i}\\}$ \nis a set of returns of some indices (they are our explanatory variables), and $\\alpha$ is what is supposed to \nbe **the manager added value**. \nIn this kind of analysis the coefficients $\\beta$ represent the \n**exposures to the chosen types of market returns** and they \nare constrained to sum to $1$. This way, they represent portfolio weights in the explanatory variables:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^N \\beta_i = 1.\n$$","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Factor Analysis of Warren Buffet Berkshire Hathaway\n\nLet us load the returns of the Berkshire Hathaway holding company.

The exercise can reveal drifts in a manager's style as well as provide insight into what the manager is likely doing to obtain the returns.\n\nTo run the Sharpe Style analysis we will use a **quadratic optimizer** to find the weights that minimizes the square of the difference between the observed series and the returns of a benchmark portfolio that holds the explanatory building blocks in those same weights. \nThat is, **we minimize the tracking error between the two return series**:\n$$\n\\begin{cases} \n\\text{minimize} \\; &E(\\beta_i)  \\\\\n&\\sum_{i=1}^N \\beta_i = 1,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere the **tracking error** is given by:\n$$\nE(\\beta_i) := \\sqrt{ \\sum_{t}\\left( r_t^m - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\beta_i r_t^i \\right)^2 }.\n$$\nFirst of all, we use the industry returns:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ind_rets = erk.get_ind_returns()[\"2000\":]\nind_rets.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.789446Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.789954Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.894705Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.789883Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-07T12:13:09.893253Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We now construct **an artificial manager return** (i.e. the reuturn of a stock). \nSuppose that he invests in $30\\%$ Beer, $50\\%$ in Smoke, and $20\\%$ in \nother things that have an average return of $0\\%$ and an annualized volatility of $15\\%$:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"mgr_rets = 0.3*ind_rets[\"Beer\"] + 0.5*ind_rets[\"Smoke\"] + 0.2*np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=0.15/np.sqrt(12), size=ind_rets.shape[0])\nmgr_rets.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-07T12:16:36.952425Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-07T12:16:36.952972Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-07T12:16:36.997960Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-07T12:16:36.952913Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-07T12:16:36.996725Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, **assume we knew absolutely nothing about this manager** and all we observed was the returns. **How could we tell what she was invested in?** We could run the style analysis in which we try to decompose the return of the manager into a weigthed portfolio of stocks in the industry:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"weights = erk.style_analysis(mgr_rets, ind_rets)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-07T12:16:49.603470Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-07T12:16:49.603903Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-07T12:16:50.640639Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-07T12:16:49.603869Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-07T12:16:50.639457Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"weights.sort_values(ascending=False).plot.bar(grid=True, figsize=(11,4))\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-07T12:16:52.466837Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-07T12:16:52.468248Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-07T12:16:53.022603Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-07T12:16:52.468201Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-07T12:16:53.020934Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that we got about $50\\%$ in Smoke and $35\\%$ in Beer, which is pretty accurate, plus other investments in industries \nthat eventually we know that are not true (since we artificially invented the manager returns).  \n\nWe could in pricnciple run a **linear regression** as well:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"betas = erk.linear_regression(mgr_rets, ind_rets).params","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-07T12:17:01.548989Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-07T12:17:01.549418Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-07T12:17:01.601499Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-07T12:17:01.549386Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-07T12:17:01.598974Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"betas.sort_values(ascending=False).plot.bar(grid=True, figsize=(11,4))\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-07T12:17:05.642031Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-07T12:17:05.642448Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-07T12:17:06.200466Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-07T12:17:05.642413Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-07T12:17:06.199204Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note that now we obtain negative indices (since in the regression problem we do not impose any constraint).
